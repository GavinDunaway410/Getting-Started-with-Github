  ## Questions:
  *1. For a high drive frequency, the pendulum would likely begin to sway with increased movement, as there would be additional force acting upon the bob outside of just gravity.
  *2. If the pivot point were to suddenly drop abruptly, the displacement angle would also suddenly increase, as inertia should cause the bob to remain in its position before the tension from the shifting position of the pivot point would have an opportunity to act upon the system.
  *3.
