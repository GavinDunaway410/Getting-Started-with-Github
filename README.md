**BOLDED** text can be created using the asterisk on either side of the desired text (*). The degree of "boldness" is dependent on the number of asterisks used.
  ## Questions:
  * 1. For a high drive frequency, the pendulum would likely begin to sway with increased movement, as there would be additional force acting upon the bob outside of just gravity.
  * 2. If the pivot point were to suddenly drop abruptly, the displacement angle would also suddenly increase, as inertia should cause the bob to remain in its position before the tension from the shifting position of the pivot point would have an opportunity to act upon the system.
  * 3. If the pivot point moves down just as the pendulum bob begins to fall, then the pendulum will fall at a rate consistent with both the gravitational force acting on the pendulum as well as the movement already being experienced by the bob, but ultimatley it depends on the speed of the movement downwards. If the movement is slow, then the bob will only slightly fall slower, but if the movement is fast, then the bob may display very little downward swing.
